Module 9 surfs_up analysis

## Overview of the Surfs_Up Analysis Project
The purpose of the Surfs_Up analysis was to assess opportunities to open surf and shakes shops in Hawaii. After visiting last year, I decided that I'd like to relocate there permanently and determined that the surf and shakes shop business idea would be a sound business opportunity. This analysis was also prepared for the investor, W. Avy, and was intended to learn more about weather patterns and environment for surf and shakes shops. The analysis focuses on temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, with the goal of understanding whether or not the surf and shake shop could be a prime business opportunity here year-round.

## Results
The results of this analysis suggest that the surf and shake shop is a solid, year round business opportunity in hawaii based on weather data as follows: 
- The mean temperature only varies by 3 degrees comparing June and December and is above 70 degrees in both months
- The minimum temperature in December does get about 9 degrees colder than June (56 vs. 64), but surfing is still possible
- The maximum temperature for both months is over 80 degrees

## Summary 
The overall results of this analysis show minimal variance in temperatures between June and December. Despite a much lower minimum temperature, the mean temperatures and max temperatures are very similar and all support the surf and shakes business model. The analysis did show increased variance in temperatures in December, as opposed to June. To further assess this business model, I would run additional queries including volume and frequency of rainfall and assessment of wind speed (which could both negatively impact surfing and icecream consumption habits).
